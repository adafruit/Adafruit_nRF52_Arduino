# Arduino Core for Nordic Semiconductor nRF5 based boards

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5)

Program your [Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.nordicsemi.com) nRF51 or nRF52 board using the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) IDE.

Does not require a custom bootloader on the device.

## Installing

### Tools

Jlink
	
    Download and install jlink from segger

nrfutil
  
 - cd tools/nrfutil-0.5.2
 - sudo pip install nrfutil

nrfjprog

- download nRF5x-Command-Line-Tools-OSX/Linux/Win32 https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF52832#Downloads
- Extract downloaded file and add extracted path to Environment Path
- Check to make sure you could run nrfjprog from your terminal/command prompt
  
### Board Manager

 1. [Download and install the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (At least v1.6.12)
 2. Start the Arduino IDE
 3. Go into Preferences
 4. Add ```https://sandeepmistry.github.io/arduino-nRF5/package_nRF5_boards_index.json``` as an "Additional Board Manager URL"
 5. Open the Boards Manager from the Tools -> Board menu and install "Nordic Semiconductor nRF5 Boards"
 6. Select your nRF5 board from the Tools -> Board menu

#### OS Specific Setup

##### OS X

No additional setup required.

##### Linux

No additional setup required.

#####  Windows

###### Driver Setup for Segger J-Link

 1. Download [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie)
 2. Plugin Segger J-Link or DK board
 3. Start ```Zadig```
 4. Select ```Options -> List All Devices```
 5. Select ```J-Link (Interface 2)``` from the device dropdown
 6. Click ```Replace Driver```

### Flashing a SoftDevice

 1. ```cd <SKETCHBOOK>```, where ```<SKETCHBOOK>``` is your Arduino Sketch folder:
  * OS X: ```~/Documents/Arduino```
  * Linux: ```~/Arduino```
  * Windows: ```~/Documents/Arduino```
 2. Create the following directories: ```tools/nRF5FlashSoftDevice/tool/```
 3. Download [nRF5FlashSoftDevice.jar](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5/releases/download/tools/nRF5FlashSoftDevice.jar) to ```<SKETCHBOOK>/tools/nRF5FlashSoftDevice/tool/```
 4. Restart the Arduino IDE
 5. Select your nRF board from the Tools -> Board menu
 6. Select a SoftDevice from the Tools -> "SoftDevice: " menu
 7. Select a Programmer (J-Link, ST-Link V2, or CMSIS-DAP) from the Tools -> "Programmer: " menu
 8. Select Tools -> nRF5 Flash SoftDevice
 9. Read license agreement
 10. Click "Accept" to accept license and continue, or "Decline" to decline and abort
 11. If accepted, SoftDevice binary will be flashed to the board

### From git (for core development)

 1. Follow steps from Board Manager section above
 2. ```cd <SKETCHBOOK>```, where ```<SKETCHBOOK>``` is your Arduino Sketch folder:
  * OS X: ```~/Documents/Arduino```
  * Linux: ```~/Arduino```
  * Windows: ```~/Documents/Arduino```
 3. Create a folder named ```hardware```, if it does not exist, and change directories to it
 4. Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5.git sandeepmistry/nRF5```
 5. Restart the Arduino IDE

## BLE

This Arduino Core does **not** contain any Arduino style API's for BLE functionality. All the relevant Nordic SoftDevice (S110, S130, S132) header files are included build path when a SoftDevice is selected via the `Tools` menu.

### Recommend BLE Libraries

 * [BLEPeripheral](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-BLEPeripheral)
   * v0.3.0 and greater, available via the Arduino IDE's library manager.
   * Supports peripheral mode only.
