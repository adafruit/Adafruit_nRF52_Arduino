- (Exe)     Added --pinresetenable option.

- (Dll)     Eliminated undesired side effect in NRFJPROG_go() function. If the device CPU was not halted when NRFJPROG_go() function was called, the device CPU was temporarily halted and restarted again.
- (Dll)     Corrected error in NRFJPROG_open_dll() function when detecting that the JLinkARM.dll version was too old.
- (Dll)     Required device connection for function NRFJPROG_read_device_version() for nRF52 devices. It will therefore fail if the device is readback protected.

Release 8.3.0
Changelog
---------------------------------------
- (Exe)     Fixed bug in parsing a hex file in --program and --verify when hex file contained a line with less than 4 bytes of data.

- (Dll)     Improved NRFJPROG_write() function to handle non multiple of 4 write lengths.
- (Dll)     Added NRFJPROG_rtt_is_control_block_found() function.
- (Dll)     Fixed bug in NRFJPROG_rtt_stop(). If the sequence NRFJPROG_rtt_start() -> NRFJPROG_rtt_stop() -> NRFJPROG_rtt_start() was executed, the second
            NRFJPROG_rtt_start () only searched for the RTT Control Block in the address the block was found in the first NRFJPROG_rtt_start().  The side-effect
            of this fix is that if you were performing NRFJPROG_rtt_start() -> NRFJPROG_rtt_stop() -> NRFJPROG_rtt_start() with the RTT Control Block in the
            same address, the second NRFJPROG_rtt_start() will take longer than before.

Release 0.2.5
Changelog
---------------------------------------
-- removing uicrwritereg option as same functionality can be achieved using memwr option.
-- using --memwr for non-flash addresses will not configure nvmc for write/read/erase enable.
-- adding --hexuicrinfo that reads the hex file and dumps (to stdout) UICR-> CR0, RBPCONF and/or FWID if they are to be programmed from hex file
-- changed the default J-Link speed to 10MHz (previous 1MHz) if not set expplicitly by --clockspeed option
-- added --dmemwr option, dumb write instruction to cpu. This option is not flash aware. It takes the same arguments like memwr,

Known Issuees
----------------------
-- writing to a flash memory using --memwr option is erasing the page first before write, this is done within segger dll and this issue
   will be addressed very soon.

Release 0.2.4
Differences from the previous release
---------------------------------------
-- implemented --w option for --memrd. you can dump values in either 8(Default). 16 or 32 bit format
-- implemented --recover option which can be used to disable system off and erase code regions and then enable system off again
       can be used to recover chips in system off without wakeup source configured

Release 0.2.3
Differences from the previous release
---------------------------------------
- fixed a bug that is causing the pop up window with multiple seggers connected and even if serial number was given as argument.

Release 0.2.2
Differences from the previous release
---------------------------------------
 - fixed bug that --n option (as in --memrd 0XSomething --n 20) was considering the number in hex, its a number of bytes
       in decimal radix 10.
 - added -p, --pinreset option to do a hard pin reset
 - adding --run option to set --pc (program counter) and --sp (stack pointer)
 - added  --hexuicrinfo    <hex_file>         Reads the hex file and dumps (to stdout) UICR-> CR0, RBPCONF and/or FWID if they are to be programmed from hex file
                                              Note: only those registers are shown whose addresses exist in the hex file
 - more bug fixes.


Release 0.2.1
Differences from the previous release
---------------------------------------
 - bug with the utility that did not work on XP (now fixed)
 - "--rbp CR0" is not allowed when CR0 is not defined in FICR or UICR. (use --clenr0 to set the CR0 first)
 - --rbp is allowed to be used with --program (application) option
 - auto backup file extention changed from .txt to .log which are easy for auto clean operations.
 - --eraseuicr option added
 - added info that -e, --eraseall is not available for factory programmed chips
 - added more checks for eraseall and eraseuicr for factory programmed and non factory programmed.
 - added --memrd option (courtesy nrfprog, works exactly the same way)
 - added --memwr option

Release 0.2
Differences from the previous release
---------------------------------------
 - Adding -v or --version option to know the version of this utility
 - EraseAll will not do an implicit reset (but --programs will do implicit eraseall and a reset)
 - --clenr0 and/or --rbp options cannot be used with --program
 - cannot use --clenr0 option with --programs if the hex file is programming to UICR->CLENR0
 - cannot use --rbp option with --programs if the hex file is programming to UICR->RBP
 - hex files can now contain uicr address ranges (usable only by --programs).
 - bufferring all flash segment writes so that user sees only one write operation per hex file
 - check first in the local directory for JLinkARM.dll (useful for standalone apps) before checking registry for its installed path.
 - hex files cannot contain uicr address range with --program option
 - check application base address to match CR1 base address (on protected chips), if not match then return error with flash untouched.
 - removing --bin option to keep it simple
 - added few more error codes
 - wrong serial number given as the argument will return error and the program will quit


Release 0.1.3
Differences from the previous release
----------------------------------------
 - added error codes to handle different errors and return to the caller (for error codes @ref nrfjprog.h)
 - added --rbp option to enable readback protection for cr0 and cr0+cr1
 - when using --programs option readback protection is not changed (in earlier version using this option would set RBPCONF to CR0)
 - --clenr0 option must now be used with --programs to protect the softdevice else programming softdevice will fail
 - added --readuicr option to read uicr page into given file
 - removed flashing binary file check and support for --program
 - able to read uicr address range from hex file and write to UICR page

Release 0.1.2
differences from the previous release
---------------------------------------
 - few bug fixes
 - reducing wait time for each operation by correctly waiting on the ready flag
 - adding reset -r option (-e option does an reset implicitly)
 - added --uicrwritereg value to write to uicr register (remember only 1's can be changed to 0's)
 - Searching segger installation in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE also for buildservers to work properly. Segger will include
            in their next release to add a key to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE root
